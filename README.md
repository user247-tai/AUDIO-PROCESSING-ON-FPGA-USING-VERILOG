# AUDIO-PROCESSING-ON-FPGA-USING-VERILOG
This project aims to develop a high-performance audio processing system using FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The main goal is to optimize real-time audio processing with the flexibility and customization of the FPGA.

This project includes interfacing with CODEC audio chip on DE2 FPGA and working with DAC and ADC on FPGA. In addition, this project has some additional applications in audio processing such as high-pass filtering, low-pass filtering and middle-pass filtering. The input sound from the device will be processed and output to the speaker connected to the FPGA.
